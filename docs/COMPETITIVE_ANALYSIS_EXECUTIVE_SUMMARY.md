## THE OPPORTUNITY

You're competing in a **fragmented market** with clear weaknesses:
- Enterprise platforms too expensive (SkyCiv $50-200/mo, Calcs similar)
- Free calculators not ASCE 7 compliant (Omni Calculator - physics only)
- Outdated competitors (BuildingsGuide uses ASCE 7-05!, Medeek uses 7-10)
- Narrow tools (Oasis does doors/windows only)
- International focus (Steel Institute is UK only)

**YOUR ADVANTAGE:** You fill the perfect middle ground - professional ASCE 7-22 compliant calculations, affordable pricing, US market specialization, 24 years credibility, and PE certification.
