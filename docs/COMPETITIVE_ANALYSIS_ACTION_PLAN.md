---

## RISK MITIGATION

### Risk 1: Content Quality Suffers from Speed
**Mitigation:** Use templates, AI assistance for drafting, but always human edit
**Quality Check:** Each page reviewed for accuracy, completeness, value

### Risk 2: Outreach Gets Ignored
**Mitigation:** Personalize every email, offer genuine value, be patient
**Follow-up:** 2 follow-ups spaced 1 week apart, then move on

### Risk 3: Rankings Don't Improve
**Mitigation:** Focus on long-tail first, build authority gradually
**Pivot Plan:** If no movement by Week 8, consider PPC for quick wins while SEO builds

### Risk 4: Burnout from Aggressive Timeline
**Mitigation:** Batch content creation, use tools/automation, delegate if possible
**Reality Check:** 90-day plan is aggressive but achievable with focus

---

## DELEGATION OPPORTUNITIES

### Can Be Delegated (Consider VA or Contract)
- State page research (wind speeds, codes, PE requirements)
- Image optimization and compression
- Directory submissions
- Basic outreach email sending (from template)
- Spreadsheet tracking
- Social media posting

### Must Be Done In-House
- Strategy decisions
- Final content editing
- Relationship building (important backlinks)
- Technical implementation
- Calculator integration
- PE seal services

### Hybrid Approach
- **VA does:** Research, first draft, image work, admin
- **You do:** Final edit, strategy, relationships, technical
- **Cost:** $15-25/hr for VA, 10-20 hours/week = $600-2,000/mo

## NEXT IMMEDIATE STEPS (TODAY)

1. **Save this action plan** for reference
2. **Review full competitive analysis** (COMPETITIVE_ANALYSIS_2025.md)
3. **Decide on budget** (tools, possibly VA help)
4. **Block calendar time** for content creation and outreach
5. **Start Week 1 Day 1 tasks** (Google Search Console, Analytics setup)
6. **Commit to 90-day execution**

**The plan is clear. The opportunity is massive. The competition is weak. Time to execute.**
