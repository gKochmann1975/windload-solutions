## Next Steps

Due to context limitations, these 9 pages should be created using one of these approaches:

### Option 1: Manual Creation (Recommended for Quality)
1. Copy an existing bridge page as template
2. Update gradient, titles, descriptions for each
3. Update CTA links to match windloadcalc.com structure
4. Add relevant internal links
5. Verify all pages load correctly

### Option 2: Script-Based Generation (Faster, but less custom content)
1. Create Node.js script to generate all 9 pages
2. Use template with variable replacement
3. Automatically insert correct gradients, CTAs, links
4. Review and customize content after generation

### Option 3: Split Session Approach
1. Complete 4-5 pages in current session
2. Continue remaining pages in new session
3. Ensures quality and proper context
