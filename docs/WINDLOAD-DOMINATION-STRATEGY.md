# WINDLOAD.CO DOMINATION STRATEGY
## 11/10 Plan to Become #1 for Wind Loads on the Planet

**Date:** November 27, 2025
**Properties:** windload.co, windload.solutions, windloadcalc.com
**Goal:** Total market domination for wind load calculations globally

---

## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This strategy leverages windload.co as the **offensive weapon** in a three-domain arsenal to capture every possible wind load customer on earth. While windload.solutions educates and windloadcalc.com converts, windload.co becomes the **rapid-deployment marketing machine** that outflanks competitors at every touchpoint.

**The 11/10 Difference:** We're not just doing SEO better. We're creating an entirely new category of wind load marketing that competitors can't copy because they don't have the three-domain infrastructure.
